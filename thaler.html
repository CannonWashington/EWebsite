   <h2>Inciting Incident</h2>
    <p>In July of 2019, Stephen Thaler, an AI researcher and Physicist, filed for two patents in the United States. Neither are necessarily important to the case as a whole, other than the fact that they were made by Thaler's AI, DABUS.</p>
    <p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office denied the claim on the basis that an AI is unable to hold patent rights. Thaler filed a complaint against the USPTO and its Director,attempting to overturn the patent denial.</p>

   <h2>Thaler's Argument</h2>
     <img src="/EWebsite/assets/img/sthaler_0.jpg" alt="Stephen Thaler"/>
     <p>Thaler emphasizes the outstanding effects that denying AI these rights now will have in the future, including on those filing on the AI's behalf. He claims it creates a situation where to secure the patents the people filling it would have to lie about who invented the item.</p>
     <p>Thaler further claimed that by allowing the AI's patent rights, the USPTO would be sticking to the mandate to promote sciences.</p>

   <h2>USPTO's Argument</h2>
     <img src="/EWebsite/assets/img/Andrei_Iancu_official_photo.jpg" alt="USPTO Ex-Director Andrei Iancu"/>
      <p>USPTO argument sites the Administrative Procedures Act, or the APA, as a defense. The APA gives courts a lot more benefit to agencies when it comes to decisions. The USPTO used this to claim that they didn't arbitrarily make a decision regarding the patents.</p>
      <p>The USPTO stands firm in its decision, and the courts will likely stand behind the agency.</p>
