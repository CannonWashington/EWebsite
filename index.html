   <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Ever since we've had the idea of autonomous machines which thought, we as humans have based media around them. Most of said media centered around killer robots which would gain senteince and attack humans. Sometimes their violent behavoir was a fault in programming, and sometimes it was due to some form of programmed in morality. </p>
    <p>Robots and AI in real life however, are far from the killing machines they are portrayed as in entertainment. Far from it, AI in real life is still not close to making its own decisions as we do. On the other two pages I have written about two real life situations involving AI and robots. </p>
