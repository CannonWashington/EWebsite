   <h2>Google's AI Builder</h2>
       <img src="/EWebsite/assets/img/Google_2015_logo.svg.png" alt="Google Logo"/>
       <p>Google Brain, a team of researchers employed by Google, created an AI capable of creating its own AI. This AI Creator, known as AutoML, essentially "trains" the AI its create, called a "child".</p>
       <p>AutoML essentially takes the AI, runs it, and then fine tunes it to be more accurate.</p>
    <h2>Google Brain's Challenge</h2>
       <p>The Google Brain researchers decided to challenge AutoML to see if it could create an AI stronger than one that a human could make. The Child AI, dubbed NASNet by the researchers, is designed to recognize objects and people in videos in real-time.</p>
       <p>AutoML would then run and calibrate NASNet thousands of times. Eventually the researchers took NASNet and ran it against ImageNet image classification and COCO object detection data sets. NASNet was 82.7% accurate, which is 1.2% more accurate than the other published results. </p>
       <p>This may not seem like a lot, but when referring to something like AI, that can be massive improvement. The researchers also cited that it was 4% more efficient as well. </p>
